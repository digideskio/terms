# About our Services Agreement

Welcome to Stripe. We developed Stripe (the “Payment Service”) to make it easy for you to accept credit and debit card payments online from your customers so you can focus on your own product or service.

Stripe incorporates two processes, the AUD Payment Service which enables you to offer your goods and services and accept card payments in Australian dollars, and the FX Payment Service which enables you to offer your goods and services and accept card payments in particular foreign currencies.

We have tried to draft this Merchant Services Agreement in a clear and simple manner. Unfortunately, the realities of the legal world make it a very difficult task. So, should you have any questions or concerns or would simply like to better understand how Stripe operates, please do not hesitate to contact Stripe directly.

Below is a quick description of the sections in this Agreement, but there are important details in the whole document, so you should read it carefully.

# The Payment Service

Stripe provides you with software and a service to process your online credit and debit card payments; Stripe will respect and protect your privacy, data and any personal information collected by Stripe in the course of providing this service. You run your business, service your customers, protect your customers’ data, report & pay taxes, and observe all laws, rules, and regulations. <a href="#section_a" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

# Registering for the Stripe Payment Service.

You provide Stripe with basic information about your company; Stripe will seek to verify your information (Stripe may work with third parties to do so) and approve your service account unless deemed risky (by Stripe or Stripe's payment processors). You give Stripe permission to do all this, and to periodically update the information or Stripe otherwise must decline to offer you the service. <a href="#section_b" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

# Receiving your Funds from Card Transactions

Stripe pays you for your transactions (minus any fees), at a schedule communicated to you once your use of a Payment Service is approved. (Payouts for your card transactions are typically sent to your bank within 7 days). A certain amount of your funds may be subject to an additional hold period (e.g. Reserve Account) with terms determined by your perceived risk and transaction history. You are responsible for refunds, returns, and liable for customer disputes (chargebacks). <a href="#section_c" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

# Termination and Other Legal Terms

National Australia Bank Limited (“NAB”) or Stripe may suspend or terminate this agreement at any time (especially if you are in breach of this agreement or are breaking the law). You can also terminate anytime. Termination is effective immediately. Termination does not alter your liability for processed payments or related chargebacks. This section also includes all the extra legal stuff they make us add (e.g. indemnification, warranties, assignment). <a href="#section_d" class="arrow">Complete details</a>

<h1 id="section_a">Section A: The Stripe Service</h1>

1. ## Stripe's Role

    The Payment Service helps you accept and process credit card, debit card and other types of card payments (collectively “cards”) from your customers who want to pay you for your products or services or give you a donation.

    Stripe is not a bank or a money transfer or remittance business (“MTRB”) and Stripe does not offer banking or MTRB services under any Relevant Law. In addition, Stripe and NAB do not assume any liability for the products or services purchased using the Payment Service. You will be required to register with Stripe to use the Payment Service (see Registering for the Payment Service).

2. ## NAB Services

    NAB has agreed to provide the NAB Services to you in connection with the provision by Stripe to you of the AUD Payment Services, and directly to you in respect of the FX Payment Service. You acknowledge and agree that:
    (1) you may benefit from the NAB Services provided to Stripe;
    (2) nothing in this Agreement is to be taken to be an offer by NAB to provide, or to be an obligation to provide, the NAB Services or any other service other than the FX Payment Service directly to you;
    (3) NAB is not liable to you in respect of any amount payable to you in connection with your use of the AUD Payment Services;
    (4) the amount of any transaction processed as a card payment using the NAB Services will be paid to Stripe by NAB and will be credited to your nominated account by us under the terms of this Agreement;
    (5) Stripe is responsible for dealing with complaints or disputes relating to the Payment Services and you will refer any such complaints or disputes ("Dispute") immediately to Stripe for resolution in accordance with Stripe's dispute resolution procedures;
    (6) you will provide all assistance reasonably required by Stripe to resolve a Dispute; and
    (7) NAB is not liable (including liability for negligence) for any loss or damage caused directly or indirectly to you by NAB's provision, or failure to provide, the NAB Services to Stripe.

3. ## Stripe's Software

    Stripe provide the Stripe API and other software to enable you to use the Payment Service. Stripe reserves the right to require you install or update any and all software updates to continue using the Payment Service. The Payment Service also includes software to help you manage recurring and subscription billing charges for your products and services.

    It is your responsibility to obtain your customers’ consent to be billed on a recurring basis in accordance with Section C.6, in compliance with applicable legal requirements and Card Scheme payment rules.

4. ## Your obligations

    You:
    (a) must immediately notify Stripe of any change to your financial position which may affect your ability to perform your obligations under this Agreement; and
    (b) must not carry on business in a place which has not been approved by Stripe and must not move any of your places of business without Stripe's prior written consent; and
    (c) must only use the Payment Service for  a sales transaction where you are the supplier of the goods and/or services; and
    (d) must not submit Payment Service transactions on behalf of a third party. For the avoidance of doubt, this includes submitting transactions for goods or services sold on another Person's website; and
    (e) must allow the employees, contractors or agents of Stripe, NAB or any Card Scheme reasonable access to your premises during normal business hours to check your compliance with this Agreement, the Data Security Standards or for the purposes of the relevant Card Scheme Rules; and
    (f) must provide Stripe and NAB with all information and assistance Stripe or NAB reasonably require to perform Stripe's or NAB's obligations under this Agreement or in relation to the NAB Services and to deal with any queries in relation to the Payment Service; and
    (g) must comply with all applicable Card Scheme Rules and Relevant Laws and contractual requirements in accepting card payments and performing your obligations under this Agreement; and
    (h) will observe and implement the fraud prevention procedures set out in the manuals, guides or directions provided to you, unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties.

5. ## Authorization for Handling of Funds

    By accepting this agreement, you authorise Stripe to hold, receive, and disburse funds on your behalf when such funds from your card transactions are settled by NAB. You further authorise Stripe to instruct NAB in the manner of how your card transaction settlement funds should be disbursed to you (such as by direct credit or sending you a paper cheque payable to you) and the timing of such disbursements.

    By accepting this agreement, you also authorise Stripe to hold settlement funds in a deposit account pending disbursement of the funds to you in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. You agree that you are not entitled to any interest or other compensation associated with the settlement funds held in the deposit account pending settlement to your designated bank settlement account, that you have no right to direct that deposit account, and that you may not assign any interest in the deposit account.
    Stripe may periodically make available to you information in the Stripe management dashboard regarding anticipated amounts that are in the process of being received from NAB. This information does not constitute an obligation of Stripe or NAB to you. This information reflected in the Stripe management dashboard is for reporting and informational purposes only, and you are not entitled to, and have no ownership or other rights to these amounts, until such funds are credited to your designated bank settlement account.

    Your authorizations provided in this Agreement will remain in full force and effect until your Stripe account is closed or terminated.

6. ## Payment Methods

    The Payment Service supports any Australian-issued card and most non-Australian issued cards with a Visa, MasterCard, American Express or Diners Club logo including credit, debit, pre-paid, or gift cards. Stripe will only process card transactions that have been authorised by the applicable Card Scheme or card issuer.

    The AUD Payment Service supports card transactions that are charged in Australian dollar amounts.

    The FX Payment Service supports card transactions that are charged in Covered Currency amounts.

    You are solely responsible for verifying the identity of your users. Stripe and NAB do not guarantee or assume any liability for transactions authorised and completed which may later be reversed or Chargedback (see Sections C.11-13) relating to Chargebacks below).

    You are solely responsible for all reversed or Chargedback transactions, regardless of the reason for, or timing of, the reversal or Chargeback.

    Stripe may add or remove one or more types of cards as supported payment card any time.  If Stripe does so, Stripe will use reasonable efforts to give you prior notice of the removal.

7. ## FX Payment Service

    In addition to having been approved by NAB to receive the AUD Payment Service, if you have selected to apply, and have been approved by NAB, to receive the FX Payment Service in respect of one or more Covered FX Currencies, you may offer your goods or services to be paid for in that Covered Currency or Covered Currencies on your website.

    Any card transaction that is processed in a Covered Currency will be processed by NAB under the FX Payment Service in accordance with this Section A. 7 and the remainder of this Agreement.

    All card transaction amounts that are processed under the FX Payment Service will be automatically converted into Australian dollars (AUD) by NAB at a time and exchange rate determined by NAB and not by Stripe.

    The FX Payment Service is provided by NAB, subject to the following terms:
    (a) the exchange rate used in the conversion of Covered Currency transaction amounts into AUD will be the rate that applies at the time that the currency exchange is booked by NAB, which may be up to two business days after the day that the card transaction was processed in the Covered Currency;
    (b) the conversion rate used by NAB to convert the Covered Currency to Australian dollars will be sourced from the traded “Reuters D2” offer rate at the time of booking the conversion and will include a margin to NAB. The margin at the time of preparation of this document is 1.8%. NAB may vary the margin upon 30 days notice to you, which may be provided via Stripe;
    (c) while NAB publishes daily indicative exchange rates on its website, the rates applicable to the FX Payment Service may differ from this rate;
    (d) NAB will determine the actual time at which it will perform the exchange between the Covered Currency and Australian dollar;
    (e) Stripe will notify you of the fees and charges relating to the FX Payment Service from time to time; and
    (f) Covered Currency transactions will be processed and settlement amounts will be paid to you in accordance with Section C: Processing Card Transactions and Receiving Your Funds.

    You acknowledge and understand that because NAB will determine the actual time when it will perform the currency exchange, the rate of exchange may have changed from the time when your customer made the payment in the Covered Currency to the time when it is exchanged to Australian dollars. The amount you will receive in Australian dollars may therefore be greater or less than the amount you would have received if the exchange had occurred at the time of customer’s purchase.

    If a transaction for which the proceeds were converted to AUD using the FX Payment Service is subsequently Chargedback or refunded, the Chargedback or refunded amount will be re-converted into the currency associated with the original charge using the FX Payment Service. The rate at which this re-conversion happens may be different from the rate applicable to the original conversion.

8. ## Customer Service

    Stripe will provide you with customer service to resolve any issues relating to your Stripe account, your card payment processing and use of Stripe's software, and the distribution of funds to your designated bank settlement account.

    You, and you alone, are responsible for providing service to your customers for any and all issues related to your products and services, including but not limited to issues arising from the processing of customers’ cards through the Payment Service.

9. ## Taxes

    It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the sale of your goods and services and/or the payments you receive in connection with your use of the Payment Service (“Taxes”). It is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report, or remit the correct tax to the proper tax authority.

    Stripe is not obligated to, nor will it determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any transaction.
    You acknowledge that Stripe and NAB may make certain reports to tax authorities regarding transactions that either of them process and merchants to which either of them provide the Payment Services.

10. ## Your Data Security

    You are fully responsible for the security of Data on your website or otherwise in your possession. You agree to comply with all Relevant Laws and in particular Privacy Laws in connection with your collection, security and dissemination of any Data on your website.

    You agree that at all times you shall be compliant with the Data Security Standards that apply to you. The steps you will need to take to comply with the Data Security Standards when using the Stripe Payment Service will vary based on your implementation.  For more information about implementing the Payment Service, please refer to <a href="https://stripe.com/docs">Stripe's Documentation</a>.

    If Stripe or NAB believe it is necessary based on your implementation and request it of you, you will promptly provide us with documentation evidencing your compliance with the Data Security Standards if requested by us. You also agree that you will use only Data Security Standards compliant service providers in connection with the storage, or transmission of Card Data defined as a cardholder’s account number, expiration date, and card verification value 2 ("CVV2"). You must not store CVV2 data at any time.

    You acknowledge and agree that if you fail to comply with the security protocols and standards set out in this Section:
    (a) Stripe or NAB may terminate this agreement and the Payment Services;
    (b) you are liable for any fine imposed on Stripe or NAB by any of the Card Schemes as a result of your failure to comply; and
    (c) you are liable for any fines which the Card Schemes levy in the event that you suffer a data compromise incident and have not complied with the PCI-DSS protocols.

    Information on the Data Security Standards can be found on the Payment Card Industry Council’s website. It is your responsibility to comply with these standards.

11. ## Data Breaches and Audit Right

    If Stripe or NAB believe that a Data Breach has occurred, Stripe or NAB may require you to grant access to your relevant systems and databases to Stripe or NAB or a third party auditor that is approved by Stripe or NAB or any of Stripe's or NAB's agents to conduct a security audit or forensic analysis of your systems and facilities, at your expense, and issue a report to us. You authorise us to provide this report to other banking institutions, and the Card Schemes to the extent necessary to comply with our obligations.

    If we believe that a Data Breach has occurred, in order to continue processing card transactions, we may require you to undergo a full PCI-DSS accreditation. The costs of this accreditation exercise must be paid by you.

    You acknowledge that NAB may be obliged to report all Data Breach events to Card Schemes, law enforcement agencies and/or Australian regulators. You grant irrevocable and enduring consent for NAB to release details of any such Data Breach to the aforementioned bodies.

12. ## Security

    Stripe is responsible for protecting the security of Card Data in its possession and will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect all the personal information regarding you and your customers that is stored in Stripe's servers from unauthorised access and accidental loss or modification. However, Stripe cannot guarantee that unauthorised third parties will never be able to defeat those measures or use such personal information for improper purposes.

    You acknowledge that you provide the personal information regarding you and your customers at your own risk. We recommend you review Stripe's Privacy Policy, which will help you understand how Stripe collects, use and safeguard the information you provide to us.

13. ## Your Privacy

    Your privacy and the protection of your data are very important to Stripe. You acknowledge that you have received, read in full and agree with the terms of Stripe's Privacy Policy linked to and incorporated into this Agreement by reference, by which you consent to Stripe's collection, use, retention and disclosure of personal information as well as other matters and which explains how and for what purposes Stripe collects, uses, retains, discloses and safeguards the information you provide to Stripe.

    You also acknowledge that Stripe and/or NAB may be required to report your business name and the name of your principals to the MATCH listing maintained by MasterCard and accessed and updated by Visa and American Express if applicable, pursuant to the requirements of the relevant Card Scheme Rules.

    You specifically consent to the fulfilment of the obligations related to the listing by Stripe or NAB and to the listing itself and you waive and hold harmless Stripe and NAB from all claims and liabilities you may have as a result of such reporting.

    We may disclose your Personal Information to our Related Bodies Corporate or third parties located in countries where the laws on the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information are less stringent or protective than Australia.  If you enter this agreement, you consent to the disclosure of your Personal Information overseas and Australia Privacy Principle 8.1 will not apply to this disclosure.

14. ## Privacy of Others

    You represent to Stripe that you are in compliance with all applicable Privacy Laws and you have obtained all necessary rights and consents under applicable law to disclose to Stripe, or allow Stripe to collect, use, retain and disclose any Cardholder Data that you provide to Stripe or authorise it to collect.

    You are solely responsible for disclosing to your customers that Stripe and NAB are processing credit card transactions for you and obtaining Data from you about such customers.   You will indemnify and hold both Stripe and NAB harmless from your failure to do so.

    If you receive information about others, including Cardholders, through the use of the Payment Service, you must keep such information confidential and only use it in connection with the Payment Service.   You may not disclose or distribute any such information to a third party or use any such information for marketing purposes unless you receive the express consent of the user to do so.  You may not disclose card numbers to any third party, other than in connection with processing a card transaction requested by your customer under the Payment Service.

15. ## Restricted Use

    You are required to obey all Relevant Laws applicable to your use of the Payment Service (for example, those governing financial services, consumer protections, unfair competition, anti-money laundering, anti-discrimination or false advertising).

5. ## Company Descriptions and Website URL

    Unless you are otherwise notified in writing, you must, before you accept any electronic commerce transaction over the Internet, establish and maintain at your own expense a website that complies with the requirements of this Section 5.

    As part of your registration, you must provide your website URL (e.g. www.mystore.com.au) and the name under which you do business (which may be the business’s legal name or a “doing business name”) (e.g. MyStore Online Widgets). These two fields may appear in your customers’ credit or debit card statements. To avoid customer confusion and transaction disputes, it is important that you enter a description that clearly identifies your business as well as an accurate site URL.

    The website must clearly display the following information:
    (a) your business name (and Australian Business Number as applicable);
    (b) the address of your approved place of business;
    (c) your business contact details;
    (d) a complete description of the goods and services available for purchase on your web site with the price advertised in Australian dollars or, if applicable, a Covered Currency;
    (e) details of your return and refund policy, including how a transaction can be cancelled by a Cardholder; and
    (f) details of your delivery times for goods and services, which are appropriate for the type of business you carry on. If the delivery is to be delayed, the Cardholder must be notified of the delay and an option provided to them to obtain a refund;
    (g) details of any Australian export restrictions (if applicable);
    (h) details of your privacy policy, which must include the information required by Australian Privacy Principles 1.3 and 1.4, and how you intend to deal with, or share, Personal Information obtained from and about the Cardholder; and
    (i) a description of the measures you have to maintain the security of:
    (i) Cardholders' account data;
    (ii)    any other information which, by notice, Stripe or NAB require you to display from time to time; and
    (iii)   any other information required for the purpose of complying with card scheme rules.
    You must provide Stripe reasonable access to view, monitor and audit the pages of your website.
    Your website payments page must be protected by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or any other form of security method approved in writing by Stripe.

6. ## Prohibited Businesses

    There are certain categories of businesses and business practices for which the Payment Service cannot be used (“Prohibited Businesses”).   Most, although not all, of these Prohibited Business categories are imposed by Card Scheme rules or the requirements of our banking providers or processors.  We maintain a list [here](https://stripe.com/prohibited_businesses).  By registering for Stripe, you confirm that you will not use the Payment Service to accept payments in connection with any of the Prohibited Business.  If you are uncertain as to whether your business is a Prohibited Business, or have questions about how these requirements apply to you, please contact [Stripe](mailto:support@stripe.com).

    By accepting this Agreement you confirm that you will satisfy these requirements.

<h1 id="section_c">Section C: Processing Card Transactions and Receiving Your Funds</h1>

1. ## Processing Card Transactions

    You agree that you will honour all valid and acceptable cards presented for payment by your customers for your goods and services in accordance with the Card Scheme rules, this Agreement and any operating guides that Stripe may provide you from time to time.

    You agree that you will obtain an authorization from the Card Scheme(s) for each card transaction, as required under the Card Schemes’ rules, and will not submit a card transaction for settlement where there is a negative authorization or the card is otherwise expired. You acknowledge that the existence of an affirmative authorization from Stripe or NAB or the Card Schemes does not mean that a particular card transaction will not be subject to Chargeback, Reversal or Claim at a later date.

    Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, you:
    (a) must only send Stripe a sales transaction when you have committed to provide the goods and services to the customer; and
    (b) must not accept a Card in a credit card transaction for the purpose of giving a Cardholder cash; and
    (c) must perform all obligations (including supplying all goods and/or services) to the cardholder in connection with the sale; and

    (f) must destroy any document that is no longer required to be retained, by applicable law or Card Scheme Rules, in a manner which makes the information unreadable;
    (g) must take reasonable steps to ensure that the information and documents mentioned in (d) are protected from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure;
    (h) must not make any representation in connection with any goods or services which may bind Stripe, NAB or any Card Scheme;

    (j) must not accept a Card or a transaction which is of a type you have been previously advised is not acceptable;
    (k) must provide sufficient training to your employees to ensure you meet your obligations under this Agreement; and must prominently and unequivocally inform the Cardholder of your identity at all points of Cardholder interaction (including on any relevant web site, promotional material and invoice) so that the Cardholder can readily distinguish you from Stripe, any supplier of goods or services to you, or any other third party;
    (l) must provide notice to any Cardholder with whom you enter into a transaction that you are responsible for that transaction, including for any goods or services provided, any payment transaction, related service enquiries, dispute resolution, and performance of the terms and conditions of the transaction;
    (m) must not unfairly distinguish between issuers of a Card when accepting a transaction;
    (n) must not refuse to complete a transaction solely because a Cardholder refuses to provide additional identification information in circumstances where we do not require you to obtain it;
    (o) if you collect or store Cardholder information, you must comply with any Data Security Standards notified to you; and
    (p) you may must not transfer or attempt to transfer financial liability under this Agreement by asking or requiring a Cardholder to waive his or her dispute rights.

    You will maintain appropriate records of all Card transactions for a period of at least two (2) years from the date of the transaction.

2. ## Transaction Receipt

    Unless Stripe has agreed in writing that we will provide the transaction receipt to the cardholder, you must give the Cardholder a copy of the Transaction Receipt for each transaction at the conclusion of the purchase transaction that includes all information required under Card Scheme rules and applicable law, but you must not charge a fee for doing so.


    If you are notified that you must prepare the Transaction Receipt, you must ensure the information contained in the Transaction Receipt:
    (a) is identical with the information on any other copy; and
    (b) legibly includes the information notified to you.
    You must provide Stripe with the Transaction Receipt and any other required evidence of the transaction within seven days if you are asked by Stripe to provide it.
    If you wish to change your Internet or email address, or telephone number appearing on the Transaction Receipt, you must notify Stripe in writing at least 15 Banking Days prior to the change taking effect.

    (l) this Agreement was terminated before the date of the transaction;
    (m) you have not complied with your obligations in Section C.1;
    (n) if applicable, the details are keyed into Equipment and you did not legibly record on a Transaction Receipt the information required by 2;

    (i) the amount of the transaction or transactions on the same occasion is more than any applicable limit notified to you;

    (t) it is of a class which NAB or Stripe decide, in their discretion, is not acceptable.

    (u) refuse to accept a transaction if it is invalid or unacceptable, or may charge it back to you if it has already been processed, even if Stripe or NAB have given you an authorisation; and
    (v) reverse a sales transaction as a Chargeback, and debit your account for the amount of the chargeback, for any of the reasons in Section 3(a) through (t) or any other reason we notify you of from time to time; and
    (w) without limiting the above, delay, block, freeze or refuse to accept any transaction where NAB or Stripe have reasonable grounds to believe that the transaction breaches Australian law or sanctions or the laws or sanctions of any other country.
    You cannot infer from the fact that a cardholder has been issued with a nominated card, or that a transaction has been processed or an authorisation has been given, that we have guaranteed:
    (x) the cardholder's creditworthiness; or
    (y) the correct identity of the cardholder; or
    (z) that the transaction is valid and acceptable and will not be subsequently charged back or reversed; or
    (aa)    that you have complied with your obligations under this agreement and you waive any right to claim that we do.

    (a) use reasonable care to detect forged or unauthorised signatures or the unauthorised use or forgery of a Card; and
    (b) notify Stripe if you become aware of or suspect fraud on the part of a Cardholder; and

5. ## Surcharging

    5.1 Definitions. For the purpose of this Section C.5, the following words or phrases have the following meanings:"Surcharge"" means any fee charged by a merchant to a cardholder that is added to a transaction for the acceptance of a card; and "reasonable costs of card acceptance" are costs that will be determined having regard to the Reserve Bank of Australia’s Guidance Note: Interpretation of Surcharging Standards, as amended or replaced from time to time.

    5.2 Amount of surcharge
    (a) Where you elect to charge a cardholder a surcharge in respect of a transaction, you must not impose a surcharge in excess of the reasonable cost of card acceptance.
    (b) Upon request by Stripe or any card schemes, you must produce supporting information to substantiate your costs of card acceptance.  Where the card scheme dictates the format of the required substantiation, e.g. through use of a "reasonable cost of acceptance calculator", you must provide details of your costs in the required format.
    (c) Where required by a card scheme, you must submit, at your cost, to an audit of your costs of card acceptance by an independent auditor approved by the Card Scheme requiring the audit. The audit must be completed and results reported back to the relevant card scheme within the timeframe specified by the Card Scheme.
    (d) Where, following an investigation into your surcharging and cost of card acceptance, we or a card scheme determine that the amount that you are surcharging exceeds the reasonable costs of card acceptance, we may, by 30 days notice to you, require you to reduce your surcharge level to an amount that does not exceed the reasonable costs of card acceptance.
    (e) Without limiting any other rights that we may have under this agreement, we may, by notice to you, terminate this agreement if, following receipt of notice under this Section, you fail to reduce your surcharge level to an amount that does not exceed the reasonable costs of card acceptance.
    (f) You acknowledge that excessive surcharging by you could expose NAB to fines from card schemes.  You agree to indemnify NAB against any fines imposed by card schemes in relation to your surcharging practices.
    (g) You acknowledge that card issuers may from time to time change the classification of a credit card (ie. standard or premium) and, as a result, when applying a surcharge rate to a cardholder, it cannot be guaranteed that the classification of the card (ie. standard or premium) on which you have based the surcharge will be same as the classification on which you are charged your merchant service fee in relation to the same transaction.

    5.3 Disclosure of surcharge.  You must clearly disclose to the cardholder before the transaction is completed any surcharge that you will charge for completing the transaction, and do it in such a way that allows the transaction to be cancelled without the cardholder occurring any cost.
    (i) You must display on the payment page on your website a notice stating:
    (i) that you charge a surcharge; and
    (ii)    the exact amount or percentage of the surcharge.
    (j) You must not represent or otherwise imply that the surcharge is levied by a card scheme, by Stripe or NAB or any other financial institution.

6. ## Payouts and Transaction History

    NAB will settle, on each business day, the gross amount of all funds received from the card schemes in respect of transactions processed under this agreement, less any Chargebacks or refunds.

    You authorise and direct NAB to pay all amounts due to you under this agreement to Stripe, who you appoint as your agent for the purpose of receiving all settlement funds payable by NAB to you under this agreement.

    Stripe will pay out funds settling from NAB to your designated bank settlement account in the amounts actually received (less Stripe's Fees as defined below) for card transactions submitted to the Payment Service. The payouts will be made to the bank account (“Bank Account”) you specify in your Stripe account. The Bank Account must be located at a bank in Australia and held in the name of your business as you have identified it to Stripe. You are responsible for the accuracy and correctness of information regarding your Bank Account.

    Funds for any given transaction will not be transferred to your Bank Account until the transaction is considered complete. Transactions will be considered complete when Stripe has received funds in settlement from NAB. The actual timing of the transfers to your Bank Account of the settling funds will be subject to the Payout Schedule as defined below.

    After each payout of card settlement funds to your Bank Account, Stripe will update information in your Stripe management dashboard to reflect settlement. Information regarding your card transactions processed and settled with the Payment Services (“Transaction History”) will be available to you when you login to Stripe's website. Stripe provide a minimum of one year of Transaction History on Stripe's website.

    Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for compiling and retaining permanent records of all transactions and other data associated with your use of Stripe, your Transaction History and your use of the Payment Service.

    You acknowledge and agree that:
    (a) payment of the settlement funds by NAB to Stripe in accordance with your direction under this Section 6 will satisfy NAB’s obligation to you in respect of settlement of those funds;
    (b) Stripe is responsible for disbursing any amounts received from NAB to you, in accordance with your payout arrangements with Stripe; and
    (c) NAB will not be liable for any failure by Stripe to account to you for any funds received from NAB.

7. ## Payout Schedule

    Payout schedule refers to the time it takes for Stripe to initiate a transfer to your Bank Account of settlement funds arising from card transactions processed through the Payment Service (“Payout Schedule”).  Stripe’s general Payout Schedule will be identified on <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/transfers">https://stripe.com/docs/transfers</a> or a successor website, and will typically be a rolling schedule (e.g., and for example only, 7 days) from the date of charge.  Stripe may change the Payout Schedule periodically as permitted under this Agreement.

    Once your bank account information has been reviewed, Stripe will initiate transfer of settlement funds (less any Fees, Chargebacks, and other funds owed to Stripe for any reason) in accordance with the Payout Schedule, the terms of which will be made available to you when you login to your Stripe management dashboard. The settlement funds should normally be credited to your Bank Account within 1-2 days of Stripe initiating the payout.

    Stripe is not responsible for any action taken by the institution holding your Bank Account that may result in some or all of the funds not being credited to your Bank Account or not being made available to you in your Bank Account.

    You can contact Stripe to inquire about changing the timing of your Payout Schedule. Upon submitting a request, you will be informed of the process and requirements for Stripe to review your Payout Schedule.

    Stripe and NAB reserve the right to change the Payout Schedule or suspend payouts to your Bank Account should we determine it is necessary due to pending disputes, excessive or anticipated excessive Chargebacks or refunds, or other suspicious activity associated with your use of the Payment Service or if required by law or court order.

8. ## Recurring transactions

    You may only process a transaction as a recurring transaction if:
    (a) you have obtained cardholder permission (either electronically or in hardcopy) to periodically charge for a recurring service and have provided notice (e.g. via email) prior to each successive charge; and
    (b) you retain this permission for the duration of the recurring services and make it available to us on request; and
    (c) you provide a simple and accessible online cancellation procedure, if the cardholder request for the goods or services was initially accepted online.

9. ## Reconciliations and Errors

    Your Transaction History will be available to you when you login to the Stripe management dashboard. Except as required by law, you are solely responsible for reconciling your Transaction History with your actual card payment transactions.

    You agree to notify Stripe of any discrepancies arising from such reconciliation and verification. Stripe will investigate any reported discrepancies and attempt to rectify any errors that you or we discover. In the event you are owed money as a result of the discrepancy, Stripe will transfer funds to your Bank Account in the next scheduled payout. Your failure to notify Stripe of an error or discrepancy in your Transaction History within sixty (60) days of when it first appears on your Transaction History will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you in connection with any such error or discrepancy in processing your card payments.

    If you submit or cause Stripe to process transactions erroneously, you agree to contact Stripe immediately to report this error. Stripe will investigate any reported errors and attempt to rectify any errors that you or Stripe discovers by crediting or debiting your Bank Account as appropriate.  Your failure to notify Stripe of a processing error within thirty (30) days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you by Stripe or NAB.

10. ## Refunds and Returns

    By accepting this Agreement, you agree to submit any and all refunds and adjustments for returns of your products and services through the Payment Service to the cardholder's card in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and Card Scheme Rules. Card Scheme Rules require that you will:
    (a) maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy;
    (b) disclose your return or cancellation policy to customers at the time of purchase;
    (c) not give cash refunds to a customer in connection with a Card sale, unless required by law; and
    (d) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a Card sale refund.

    You must only submit a transaction as a refund to a Cardholder if it is a genuine refund of a previous sale transaction. The refund must be processed to the same card that was used in the original sales transaction and be for the exact dollar amount of the original transaction including tax, handling charges, and any other fees or charges or, if the cardholder has agreed to a partial refund, the amount of that partial refund. The refund amount may not exceed the original sale amount except by an amount equal to any reimbursements to customer for postage costs incurred for product returns. You will use best efforts to process all refunds within sixty (60) days after the original transaction date, and you acknowledge that refunds processed after that time may not be capable of being processed

    For processed refunds, Stripe will deduct the refund amount (including any applicable Fees) from:
    (e) settlement funds owed to you from processing of other card transactions; or
    (f) funds in any Reserve Account.
    If these funds are not sufficient, you authorise Stripe to initiate a direct debit to your Bank Account in the amount necessary to complete the refund transaction to the Cardholder’s card. In the event Stripe cannot access your Bank Account by means of direct debit, you agree to pay all funds owed to Stripe upon demand. You are solely responsible for accepting and processing returns of your products and services; Stripe has no responsibility or obligation for processing such returns.

11. ## Chargebacks

    A Chargeback is typically caused when a customer disputes a charge that appears on their bill. A Chargeback may result in the reversal of a transaction, with the amount charged back to you. You can be assessed Chargebacks for:
    (a) customer disputes; or
    (b) unauthorised or improperly authorised transactions; or
    (c) transactions that do not comply with Card Scheme Rules or the terms of this Agreement or are allegedly unlawful or suspicious; or
    (d) any reversals for any reason by the Card Scheme, NAB, or the Cardholder bank.

    When a Chargeback is issued, you are immediately liable for the full amount of payment of the Chargeback plus any associated Fees, fines, expenses or penalties (including those assessed by the Card Schemes or NAB).

    You agree that Stripe may recover these amounts by debiting by means of direct debit of your Bank Account associated with your Stripe account, debiting your Reserve Account, or setting off any amounts owed to you by Stripe.

    If we are unable to recover funds related to a Chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay to Stripe the full amount of the Chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay Stripe for all costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of Stripe in connection with the collection of any unpaid Chargebacks unpaid by you.

    Further, if Stripe or NAB reasonably believes that a Chargeback is likely with respect to any transaction, Stripe or NAB may withhold the amount of the potential Chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under this Agreement until such time that:
    (e) a Chargeback is assessed due to a customer’s complaint, in which case Stripe will retain the funds;
    (f) the period of time under applicable law or regulation by which the customer may dispute that the transaction has expired; or
    (g) Stripe or NAB determines that a Chargeback on the transaction will not occur.

12. ## Contesting your Chargebacks

    You, Stripe or NAB may elect to contest Chargebacks assessed to your account. Stripe may provide you with assistance including notifications and software to help contest your Chargebacks. Stripe does not assume any liability for its role or assistance in contesting Chargebacks.

    You agree to provide Stripe or NAB with the necessary information, in a timely manner and at your expense, to investigate or help resolve any Chargeback. You also grant Stripe permission to share records or other information required with the Cardholder, the Cardholder’s financial institution, and your financial institution to help resolve any disputes. You acknowledge that your failure to provide Stripe with complete and accurate information in a timely manner may result in an irreversible Chargeback being assessed.

    If the Cardholder’s issuing bank or the Card Scheme does not resolve a dispute in your favour, Stripe may recover the Chargeback amount and any associated fees from you as described in this Agreement.

    Stripe reserves the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for processing, mediating or investigating Chargeback disputes.

13. ## Excessive Chargebacks

    At any point, Stripe, NAB, or the Card Schemes may determine that you are incurring excessive Chargebacks. Excessive Chargebacks may result in additional fees, penalties, or fines that are payable by you. Excessive Chargebacks may also result in additional controls and restrictions to your use of the Payment Service, including without limitation:

    (a) changes to the terms of your Reserve Account;
    (b) increases to your applicable Fees;
    (c) delays in your Payout Schedule; or
    (d) suspension or termination of your Stripe account and the Payment Service.
    The Card Schemes may also place additional controls or restrictions as part of their own monitoring programs for merchants with excessive Chargebacks.

14. ## Stripe Fees

    You agree to pay the Fees (“Fees”) assessed by Stripe to you for providing the Payment Services described in this Agreement. These fees will be calculated pursuant to the Fee Schedule linked to here and incorporated into this Agreement by reference. Stripe reserves the right to revise its Fees at any time, subject to a thirty (30) day notice period to you.

    You acknowledge that you are also responsible for any penalties or fines imposed on Stripe or directly to you by NAB or any Card Schemes or financial institution as a result of your activities.

15. ## Stripe's Collection Rights

    To the extent permitted by law, Stripe may collect any obligations you owe Stripe or NAB under this Agreement by deducting the corresponding amounts from the Reserve Account or from funds payable to you arising from the settlement of card transactions. Fees will be assessed at the time a transaction is processed and will be first deducted from the funds received for such transactions.

    If the settlement amounts or Reserve Account are not sufficient to meet your obligations to Stripe or NAB, Stripe may charge or debit the bank account or credit card registered in your Stripe account for any amounts owed to us.

    Your failure to fully pay amounts that you owe Stripe or NAB under this Agreement on demand is a breach of this Agreement. You will be liable for Stripe's costs associated with collection in addition to the amount owed, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and expenses, costs of any arbitration or court proceeding, collection agency fees, and any applicable interest.

    Additionally, Stripe may require a personal guarantee from a partner, proprietor, or owner of your entity for funds owed under this Agreement.  If Stripe requires a personal guarantee Stripe will specifically inform you in advance.

16. ## Reserves

    Funds held in reserves are amounts of money set aside to cover Chargebacks, refunds, or other payment obligations under this agreement (a “Reserve Account”).   Stripe, in its sole discretion, will set the terms of your Reserve Account and notify you of such terms, which may require that a certain amount (including the full amount) of the funds received for your transaction is held for a period of time or that additional amounts are held in Reserve Account.   Stripe, in its sole discretion, may elect to change the terms of the Reserve Account at any time for any reason based on your payment processing history or as requested by NAB.

    Stripe may fund the Reserve Account by means of:
    (a) any funds payouts made or due to you for card transactions submitted to the Payment Service;
    (b) amounts available in your Bank Account by means of direct debit to that Bank Account;
    (c) other sources of funds associated with your Stripe account; or
    (d) requesting that you provide funds to Stripe for deposit to the Reserve Account.

17. ## Security Interest

    You grant Stripe a lien and security interest in the Reserve Account, all Card transactions (including future Card transactions), any rights to receive credits or payments under this Agreement, and all deposits and other property of yours possessed or maintained by Stripe on your behalf to secure the performance by you of the obligations under this Agreement.

    You will execute, deliver, and pay the fees for any documents Stripe requests to create, perfect, maintain and enforce this security interest.

    For the purposes of this Section, the following words have the following meanings:

    “Claim” means a challenge to a payment that you or a buyer customer files directly with Stripe.

    “Reversal” means Stripe reverses the settlement of funds from a processed card transaction that you received because:
    (a) the card transaction is invalidated by the card issuer;
    (b) the settlement funds were sent to you in error by:

    (iii)   any of the respective affiliates, agents, directors and employees of any of the entities listed in (i) or (ii) above;

    (d) you received the payment for activities that violated this Agreement or any other Stripe agreement; or
    (e) Stripe decided a Claim against you.
    Stripe will have the final decision-making authority with respect to Claims, including without limitation claims for refunds for purchased items that are filed with Stripe by you or your customers. You will be required to reimburse Stripe for your liability. Your liability will include the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping cost (and in some cases you may not receive the item back). You will not receive a refund of any fees paid to Stripe.
    Without limiting the foregoing, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Stripe, NAB and their respective employees and agents (collectively “Disclaiming Entities”) from and against any claim, suit, demand, loss, liability, damage, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to:
    (f) your breach of any provision of this Agreement; and/or
    (g) your use of the Payment Service, including without limitation any Reversals, Chargebacks, Claims, fines, fees, penalties and attorneys’ fees;
    (h) your, or your employee’s or agent’s, negligence or willful misconduct; or
    (i) third party indemnity obligations Stripe or NAB incurs as a direct or indirect result of your acts or omissions (including indemnification of any Organization or Issuer).

    If you are liable for any amounts owed to Stripe, Stripe may immediately remove such amounts from your Reserve Account and deduct the amounts owed to Stripe from such Reserve Account funds. If you do not have sufficient funds in the Reserve Account to cover your liability, you will be required to immediately add funds additional funds to your Reserve Account to cover funds owed to Stripe. If you do not do so, Stripe may engage in collections efforts to recover such amounts from you at your cost and expense.

<h2 id="debit-authorization">Debiting your account</h2>
<p>
In the event that the net activity in your account on a day is
negative or Stripe needs you to fund your account for any other reason
relating to these Terms, you authorise and request Stripe to debit
your Bank Account by using the Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS).
</p>
<p>

amounts are correct
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
If transfers are returned to Stripe by your Bank, we may charge you a

may charge. If a debit transfer is returned to Stripe because your
Bank Account has insufficient funds, it is your responsibility to fund
the Bank Account so that we can re-process the debit transfer.
</p>

<h2>Inquiries, Errors, and Disputes</h2>
<p>
If you believe there has been an error in debiting your account, you
should <a href="https://support.stripe.com/email">notify us</a>. You can also
notify your own Bank.
</p>
<p>
If there has been an error, we'll arrange with your Bank to adjust
your account and we'll notify you of the amount of the adjustment.
</p>

<p>
If we don't find an error, we'll respond to your query with evidence
of the correctness of the transfer.
</p>

Stripe will provide you with Notice at least 14 days before any
changes to this Direct Debit Request Service Agreement. If you'd like
to amend this Direct Debit Request Service Agreement or to request
