This Stripe Marks Usage Agreement (“Agreement”) provides the legal terms governing your use of the Stripe name, logo, or other registered or unregistered Stripe trademarks and service marks owned by Stripe (“Stripe Marks”) to let your customers know that Stripe (“we”, “us”, “our”) provides services for your business. You use of services provided by Stripe is governed by the [Stripe Services Agreement](https://stripe.com/legal) (“Services Agreement”).

**You may not use any Stripe Marks unless you agree to abide by all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement.**

## 1. Permission to Use Stripe Marks

Stripe Marks are important assets of Stripe’s business and are protected by US and international laws. You may use the Stripe Marks as described in this Agreement on a non-exclusive, non-transferable basis on websites or applications that utilize Services (as defined in the Services Agreement). We may revoke this permission at any time at our discretion. We don’t expect to do this without a good reason but, if revoked, you agree to promptly remove any Stripe Marks from any websites or applications, or other material.

## 2. Use of Stripe Marks

You may only use the Stripe Marks on the portion of your website or application that directly relates to the Services, such as on a checkout page utilizing our payment processing or order services. You may not misrepresent your relationship with Stripe. You may not use Stripe Marks to show Stripe or Services in a disparaging or derogatory light, or in some other way that may be damaging to our brand or interests in Stripe Marks.

Where only the Stripe name or logo is used, as opposed to the “Powered by Stripe” or “Connect with Stripe” logos, we ask that you provide proper trademark attribution crediting ownership of the Stripe Marks to us, such as:

_The Stripe name and logos are trademarks or service marks of Stripe, Inc. or its affiliates in the U.S. and other countries. Other names may be trademarks of their respective owners._

We may also provide you with style or usage guidelines describing such things as size, color, or relative placement of Stripe Marks. You may only use the Stripe Marks consistent with those guidelines except where we expressly agree otherwise with you in writing. You will update your use of the Stripe Marks to conform to changes in the guidelines within a reasonable time after we provide you notice of the change.

## 3. Limitations on and Good Use of Stripe Marks

You may not use the Stripe Marks or any confusingly similar name or trademark with your product, service, company, or domain name. For instance, you may not use names like “Stripe Business Services”, “Stripe for Platforms” or domains like “getstripe.com.” Further, you may not use Stripe Marks to imply endorsement by Stripe of your products or services, or in a manner that causes customer confusion.

You may not display, copy, modify, or transmit the Stripe Marks except as described in this Agreement, the guidelines, or otherwise agreed in writing by Stripe.

In addition to protecting the Stripe Marks, it is important to us that you maintain an independent brand. Even where use of Stripe Marks is permitted, we suggest that you prominently use your own marks where also using Stripe Marks. For example, “Foo Analytics _for Stripe_” or “Bar Analytics _powered by Stripe_” are acceptable and emphasize your brand; but “Stripe Analytics”, “Stripe for Platforms”, or “Stripelytics” are unacceptable and emphasize the Stripe Marks.

## 5. No Warranties

As part of this Agreement, we do not make any representations regarding your use of Stripe Marks. We disclaim all warranties, express and implied, including any warranties of non-infringement.

## 6. Contacting Us

If you have any questions about this Agreement, please don’t hesitate to contact us at trademarks(at)stripe.com.

## 7. Other Legal Provisions

Except as otherwise agreed upon in writing between you and us, this Agreement is the entire agreement between you and us regarding your use of the Stripe Marks. We may terminate his Agreement at anytime upon notice to you. You may not transfer this Agreement to any third party. This Agreement is governed by the laws and dispute provisions specified in the Services Agreement, which are incorporated by reference. If any provision or portion of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then it will be reformed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible, and all remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
