# About American Express Checkout

Thank you for using [Amex Express Checkout](https://stripe.com/amex-express-checkout) with Stripe.  The Stripe integration of Amex Express Checkout allows U.S. American Express® Card Members to check out quickly at participating online merchants by using their americanexpress.com account login.  With Amex Express Checkout, Card Members simply use their existing americanexpress.com User ID and Password, and American Express auto-fills the checkout fields with their American Express Card details and relevant account information in just a few clicks. Amex Express Checkout is not a wallet, and does not require a Card Member to create or manage a new account.

# Amex Express Checkout Addendum to the Stripe Services Agreement

##9.  Implementation Guidelines

You will adhere to the following implementation guidelines and requirements:

* All allowable graphics for the Amex Express Checkout Button are available in the Documentation, which you must use as presented and may not resize, recolor, or modify.
* Where using radio button implementations, the primary implementation is to leverage the payment mark in tandem with copy “Amex Express Checkout”; the secondary implementation is to leverage the button in tandem with copy “Amex Express Checkout”; and the tertiary implementation is to leverage the copy “Amex Express Checkout” on its own.  You may not alter the spelling, capitalization, or styles for “Amex Express Checkout”.  For instance, and without limitation, “AMEX Express Checkout”, “American Express Checkout”, and “Amex Checkout” are all incorrect uses.
* You will not use any other Amex trademarks or graphics (i.e., payment acceptance mark or Amex blue box logo) instead of the approved Amex Express Checkout Button.  Payment acceptance marks on your site (as differentiated from the Amex Express Checkout Button) should always be the Amex blue box logo.
* The Amex Express Checkout Button must always be clickable where implemented.  You may not use the Amex Express Checkout Button in place of a payment acceptance mark or Amex blue box logo on your payment site.
* Amex suggests placing the Amex Express Checkout Button prior to the majority of manual entry fields, to take full advantage of the autofill capability.
